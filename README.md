# CosmosMessage to the Cosmos Community:
Hey everyone,

I’ve been reflecting on the dynamics here, and I can’t help but feel like we’re heading toward a “Tower” moment—things falling apart so they can be rebuilt better. The unfortunate part is that the breakdown is avoidable if we can put aside territorial tendencies and focus on what we all want: innovation, growth, and a thriving interchain ecosystem.

To be clear, I’m not here to fight or compete. I’m here to build. I was hoping to do that with you all, as coworkers and collaborators, not as someone working in isolation. This is the kind of thing that works better when we support each other rather than resist progress out of fear or rigidity.

I know what I’m bringing to the table. If some of you feel the same way I do—if you see the cracks forming and want to be part of building something better—you’re welcome to jump on board. We’re creating something exciting, and there’s room for anyone who wants to contribute meaningfully.

That said, I also respect if you choose to stay behind. Change isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay. But when things start to collapse, remember: the door was open, and we were ready to build something incredible together.

Wishing you all the best,
J.K. Edwards
